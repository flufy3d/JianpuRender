# jianpurender
A plain vanilla TypeScrip library to render music score in browsers

It has been created to support Tensorflow/Magenta-JS staff visualizer, but it could be used standalone.

From version 1.0.0 on, it offers access to its internal data structure `StaffModel` to process scores and hold musical blocks without visual representation. This structure will be subject to changes up to version 2.0.0 where all musical features will be achieved.

This is a **work in process** project, who has some to do list, like triplets, quintuplets and shorter-than-quarter notes aggregation into beams (instead individual note flags), but it is fully operative. It will keep on growing and evolving. Some stand alone demos will be offered (currently focused on magenta-js consumption demos), but you can watch it in action building and serving the `./test` directory on local deployment.
