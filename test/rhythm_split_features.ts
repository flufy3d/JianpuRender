    symbols complete a beat within a bar, in which case they will be ordered \
    increasing lengths from shorter to longer symbols in order to \
    symmetrically complete the starting part of the beat. Following score \
    shows three decreasing tied notes, an increasing rests set, followed by a \
    decreasing rest set and two ascending tied notes till the end of the bar, \
    tied again to note in next bar, followed by an ascending rest set to \
    complete the beat and then a regular decreasing rest. Last note makes \
    previous rest noticeable.`,
